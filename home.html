                Our project is focused on delivering an educational tool for the quantitative financial economic (QFE) program at UNC-Chapel Hill. Our client is Mike Aguilar, a professor of Economics at UNC. Specifically, our project deals with financial assets (primarily equities for now) and their optimization within a portfolio. Given a set of financial assets, our application will provide an intuitive interface with which a user can form a portfolio as well as well as observe optimal weightings of assets given a variety of factors ranging from rebalancing frequency to investor risk profile.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Currently, there exist libraries in Python that provide portfolio management and optimization functionality. However, these libraries often have no GUI or are challenging to use for less technical audiences. Furthermore, there is little to know emphasis on optimizing weights in the context of backtesting a portfolio. From a pedagogical standpoint, this could be an extremely useful tool to highlight underlying variation in macroeconomic conditions that may impact asset pricing. Thus, our goal is to extend the functionality present in Pyfolio and make it easier to use.  </span></p>

                Our project will be purely web-based, though usability from mobile devices will be a consideration in terms of design. For our frontend, we will be using Facebookâ€™s React framework and JavaScript using ECMAScript 2015 features. On our backend, we will be using Python (due to its Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy libraries). From a database perspective, we will likely use a standard relational database (SQLite more likely than not) but this is subject to change based on design decisions. </span></p>
